            <p>Hi! My name's Marcus and I'm a biologist/geochemist that really likes seaweed (peep the background)!</p>
            <br>
            <p>I've done research in a number of different environments working on a number of different species. From the secondary forests in Madagascar; the Central Pacific Ocean in French Polynesia; the Western Pacific in California; to (hopefully!) the Atlantic in the Eastern Canadian Arctic, I've worked on herpetofauna (reptiles/amphibians); lepidopterans (butterflies/moths); stony corals; estuarine fish; and most importantly— macroalgae!</p>
            <br>
            <p>I graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles in 2022 with a B.Sc. in Ecology, Evolution, & Behavior and will be pursuing a M.Sc. in Earth & Planetary Sciences at McGill University. I'm currently co-advised by Dr. Nagissa Mahmoudi and Dr. Rowan Barrett. Feel free to check out my CV down below for my actual work and research experience!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Aside from science (or science-adjacent things), I am a huge skier; am an amateur web developer (I built this from scratch! - I'm too cheap to pay squarespace), was a barback (baby bartender), have (intensely) dabbled as an aquarist/aquaculturist, and love teaching others about marine science! I'm very much a jack of all trades, master of none and am always looking for opportunities to flex my non-science muscles once in a while. Reach out if you'd ever like to chat!</p>

I was responsible for general lab maintenance, inventory, and safety while maintaining kelp-specific projects. During my time, I managed one of the first germplasm collections ("seed bank") for <i>Macrocystis pyrifera</i> in Southern California; temporarily managed the kelp elevator project investigating experimental cycling giant kelp from nutrient-rich deep water to photic surface as an offshore farm proof of concept; and worked on selectively breeding then growing out sporeless (non-reproductive) cultivars of giant kelp on-land. With our aquaculture facility housed at AltaSea, I participated in education programs (85+ students) and interviews on our work while mentoring four paid undergraduate researchers (who are all super sick!).</p>

I performed sequential nitrate/nitrite determination (and helped developed a method for doing so in small quantities and at low detection limits), phosphate, alkalinity, radiolabeled sulfate reduction measurements. I also partook in several field sampling trips and boat trips to collect cores, later preparing them in lab.</p>

I classified geomorphological processes and features of coastal estuaries, lagoons, and watersheds in California from aerial imagery and digital elevation models. This work was then translated over to understanding the geohydrology of rainwater in malibu, CA. Lastly, I worked on a collaborative project between Dr. Jacobs and Dr. Kevin Mckeegan on exploring Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) on fish otoliths as environmental geochemical markers of lagoon conditions through time.</p>

Our primary work was increasing the accessibility of ocean sciences through community lead events. Personally, my favorite event was the Biden 100 Days event, where I placed the ownership of the panel into the hands of student experts. We tracked the movements from Biden's administration in his first 100 days, during which I built a ten-week curriculum on policy making, historical trends in infrastructure, and understanding legal jargon to prepare our student speakers to act as experts. This work was important to many of us as it was the first presidential election we had partaken in. </p>

Through the seawater samples, we could estimate how much of the nitrogen observed was anthropogenic runoff versus natural sources. In the stony corals, we were exploring if there was an increase in heavier nitrogen isotopes in aposymbiotic (non-photosynthesizing) corals as photosynthetic corals would internally cycle their nitrogen. I also acted as the on-site technician for the lab's isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS) with a modified Gas Bench (for N2O analyses) and  Elemental Analyzer (EA).</p>
