            <p>Hi! My name's Marcus and I'm a scientist that really likes seaweed!</p>
            <br>
            <p>I graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles in 2022 with a B.Sc. in Ecology, Evolution, & Behavior and will be pursuing a M.Sc. in Earth & Planetary Sciences at McGill University. I'm currently co-advised by Dr. Nagissa Mahmoudi and Dr. Rowan Barrett.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Aside from science (or science-adjacent things), I am an ex-ski instructor from Lake Louise; a former students events planner; an amateur web developer (I built this from scratch! - I'm too cheap to pay for squarespace), an ex-barback, an aquarist/aquaculturist, and love teaching others about marine science! I'm very much a jack of all trades, master of none and am always looking for opportunities to flex my non-science muscles once in a while.</p>

            <p>Salut! Je m'appelle Marcus et je suis un chercheur qui aime beaucoup les macroalgues!</p>
            <br>
            <p>J'ai obtenu mon dipl&ocirc;me (B.Sc.) d'&eacute;cologie, &eacute;volution, et comportement de l'universit&eacute; de Californie, Los Angeles (UCLA) en 2022. J'&eacute;tudierai une ma&icirc;trise de sciences terrestres et plan&eacute;taires au McGill University. Je sera supervis&eacute; par Dr. Nagissa Mahmoudi et Dr. Rowan Barrett.</p>
            <br>
            <p>En dehors des sciences (ou des choses genres sciences), je suis aussi un ex-instructeur de ski &agrave; Lake Louise; un ancien organisateur d'&eacute;v&eacute;nements pour etudiants; un d&eacute;veloppeur web tr&egrave;s amateur (je l'ai construit &agrave; partir de z&eacute;ro - je suis trop radin pour payer Squarespace), un ex-barman, un aquaculteur, et j'aime enseigner les sciences marines! Je suis vraiment un touche-&agrave;-tout et je cherche toujours des opportunities pour faire les choses non-scientifique!</p>

            <p>I've worked in a number of different environments with a a variety of species. From the secondary forests in Madagascar; the Central Pacific Ocean in French Polynesia; the Eastern Pacific in Southern California; to (hopefully!) the Atlantic in Eastern Canada, I've worked on herpetofauna (reptiles/amphibians); lepidopterans (butterflies/moths); stony corals; estuarine fish; and most importantly— macroalgae!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Besides culturing seaweeds, I'm most familiar with the fate of nitrogen and sulfur in marine environments (primarily in anaerobic sediments) and geospatial information systems (GIS) as it pertains to California geomorphology. I have some background of stony coral larval proteomics, behavioral ecology, and general molecular biology. For past work, please refer to the descriptions in the CV - I go much more in depth there!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Currently, I work on the associated surface microbiome of giant kelp sporophytes from a farm in Santa Barbara and compare differences in the microbial community structure across different measured traits. I aim to take this work with me to McGill University to further examine the microbiome of seaweeds local to the Atlantic such as sugar kelp (<i>Saccharina latissma</i>) winged kelp, <i>(Alaria esculenta)</i>, or dulse (<i>Palmaria palmata</i>).</p>

I'll be advised by Nagissa Mahmoudi, a geomicrobiologist, and Rowan Barrett, a bioinformatician, and (hopefully) working on seaweed microbiomes in changing ocean conditions. Rising temperatures, oil spills, and increased nutrient runoff all threaten the biodiversity of our coastlines, although we have some idea of how macroalgae are affected at large, there is little known about the specific changes in their associated microbiota.</p>

I was responsible for general lab inventory, administration, and safety while managing kelp-specific projects. During my time, I managed one of the first germplasm collections ("seed bank") for <i>Macrocystis pyrifera</i> in Southern California; temporarily managed the kelp elevator project investigating experimental cycling of giant kelp from nutrient-rich deep water to photic surface as an offshore farm proof of concept; selectively bred then grew potentially sporeless (non-reproductive) cultivars of giant kelp on-land; and analyzed the microbiome of giant kelp sporophytes from a farm in Santa Barbara. With our aquaculture facility housed at AltaSea, I participated in education programs (85+ students and guests) and interviews on our work. During my time at USC, I was fortunate to be able to mentor five paid undergraduate researchers (who are all super sick!).</p>

I performed sequential nitrate/nitrite determination (and helped developed a method for doing so in small quantities and at low detection limits), phosphate, alkalinity, radiolabeled sulfate reduction assays. I also partook in several field sampling trips and boat trips to collect cores, later preparing them in lab.</p>

I classified geomorphological processes and features of coastal estuaries, lagoons, and watersheds in California from aerial imagery and digital elevation models. This work was then applied to understanding the geohydrology of rainwater in Malibu, CA and the distribution of an endangered tidewater goby. Lastly, I worked on a collaborative project between Dr. Jacobs and Dr. Kevin Mckeegan on exploring Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) on fish otoliths as environmental geochemical markers of lagoon conditions through time.</p>

Our primary work was increasing the accessibility of ocean sciences through community lead events. Personally, my favorite event was the Biden 100 Days event, where I placed the ownership of the panel into the hands of student experts. We tracked the movements from Biden's administration in his first 100 days, during which I built a ten-week curriculum on policy making, historical trends in infrastructure, and understanding legal jargon to prepare our student speakers to act as experts. This student-led analysis was important to many of us as it was the first presidential election we had partaken in. </p>

                        <p class="desc">Partnering with a local whale watching company, we would take local middle and high schoolers out to the open ocean to learn about marine science (and occassionally find dolphins and whales!). I taught lessons on physical oceanography and elasmobranchs while assisting in live (but temporary) specimen collections of sea stars, nudibranchs, mussels, and kelp used in the marine invertebrate lesson.</p>
